# Deep immunophenotyping reveals circulating activated lymphocytes in individuals at risk for rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease with currently no universally highly effective prevention strategies. 
Identifying pathogenic immune phenotypes in ‘At-Risk’ populations prior to clinical disease onset is crucial to establishing effective prevention strategies. 

Here, we applied mass cytometry to deeply characterize the immunophenotypes in blood from At-Risk individuals identified through the presence of serum antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPA) and/or first-degree relative (FDR) status, as compared to established RA, and healthy controls enrolled from the SERA (Studies of the Etiologies of Rheumatoid Arthritis) and the AMP RA/SLE (Accelerating Medicines Partnership Rheumatoid Arthritis/Systemic Lupus Erythematosus). This Github Repo includes the source code for the analyses involved in this study.

# Results summary

- We systematically identified **activated lymphocyte phenotypes in At-Risk individuals**, along with immunophenotypic differences between different At-Risk subpopulations.

  - We identified significant cell expansions in At-Risk individuals compared with controls, including CCR2+CD4+ T cells, T peripheral helper (Tph) cells, type 1 T helper cells, and CXCR5+CD8+ T cells.
  
  - We also found that CD15+ classical monocytes were specifically expanded in ACPA-negative FDRs, and an activated PAX5low naïve B cell population was expanded in ACPA-positive FDRs.

- We developed an **“RA immunophenotype score” classification method** based on the degree of enrichment of cell states relevant to established RA patients. 
This score significantly distinguished At-Risk individuals from controls. Our classification model provides a promising approach for understanding RA pathogenesis with the goal to improve prevention strategies and identify novel therapeutic targets.
